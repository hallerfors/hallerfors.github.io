## Projects:

### Labor Market Effects of Advance Notice  
This paper uses a 1997 reform in Sweden, which changed the length of Advance Notice (AN) from being based on the age of the worker at notice to the firm tenure of the worker at notice, to estimate causal effects on post-layoff outcomes of workers. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that lower AN leads to lower earnings and wages at the subsequent job, as well as increasing the time to finding a new job and raising the risk of ending up in unemployment.

### Effects of Local Union Representation (Joint Work)  
In this project, we explore the effects of local union representation on labor market outcomes.

### Intergenerational Effects of a Joint Tax Reform (Joint Work)
In 1971, Sweden removed joint taxation of married couples, which changed the individual incentives to work as primarily as a function of the spouse's earnings and the municipal tax rate. We estimate the first stage effect on employment for mothers and then study intergenerational effects on the children of these mothers.

### Geographical Expansion of Higher Education (Joint Work)
In 1977, Sweden introduced a reform that expanded the number of higher education institutions in the country. We study the effects of this reform on labor market outcomes for individuals who were born in municipalities that received a new higher education institution. We use a cohort difference-in-difference design to estimate the causal effects of this reform on education outcomes.

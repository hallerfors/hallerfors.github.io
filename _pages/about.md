# Labor Market Effects of Advance Notice
## This paper uses a 1997 reform in Sweden, which changed the length of Advance Notice (AN) from being based on the age of the worker at notice, to the firm tenure of the worker at notice, to estimate causal effects on post-layoff outcomes of workers. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that lower AN leads to lower earnings and wages at the subsequent job, as well as increasing the time to finding a new job and raising the risk of ending up in unemployment.
